##  Architectural Overview

This project follows a modern, decoupled architecture:
-   **Backend:** A powerful, asynchronous API built with **FastAPI (Python)**. It serves as the brain of the platform, handling all logic, device communication, and database interactions.
-   **Admin Frontend:** A feature-rich Single-Page Application (SPA) and Progressive Web App (PWA) built with **Next.js (React)** for administrators.
-   **User Frontend:** A mobile-first, installable PWA, also built with **Next.js**, providing end-users with access to services like support tickets and remote access.
